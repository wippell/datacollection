This repository provides a refuge for data related to extremism in the United States and beyond. It includes both data I have collected and publicly available data that I have expanded on or adapted to better serve my research agenda at time of use. My hope is that others can use these data to pursue their own research questions and help further our collective understanding of ideologies, extremism, and violence.
